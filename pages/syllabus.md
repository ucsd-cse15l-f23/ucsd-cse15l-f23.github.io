## Course Components {#components}

**This page is a draft that may be edited before the fall quarter starts**

There are several components to the course:

- **Lab sessions**
- **Lecture sessions**
- **Weekly quizzes**
- **Lab reports/portfolio posts**
- **Skill demonstrations**

### Labs

The course's lab component meets for 2 hours. In each lab you'll switch between
working on your own, working in pairs, and participating in group discussions
about your approach, lessons learned, programming problems, and so on.

The lab sessions and groups will be led by TAs and tutors, who will note your
participation in these discussions for credit. Note that you must
**participate**, not merely **attend**, for credit.

If you miss lab, you'll still be held accountable for understanding the
relevant material via Skill Demonstrations and Lab Reports. You can miss 2 labs
without it impacting your grade (see [Grading](#grading) below).

### Lecture Sessions

Lecture sessions are on Monday and Wednesday. You can only attend the section to which you are assigned.
Depending how things go after the first
week or two, we might relax this and allow attendance in any section.

In each lecture, we'll have a paper handout (also available electronically). At
the end of lecture you'll have a chance submit your handout to Gradescope. You
can do this by scanning it in the Gradescope app (for iOS and Android) or
through the web interface. To get participation credit for lecture, you have to
submit a handout filled in with reasonable effort. It's fine if answers aren't
right, and some days don't have right answers. It's fine if things aren't
totally complete, and some days we won't finish everything. But it should be
clear from what you submit that you followed along and worked on the exercises we did in class.

If you miss class, you can submit them up until the start of the next class as
late submissions.  We recommend completing them while watching the podcast.
We'll have TAs on hand as backup to collect the physical paper/help you scan and
submit if you have any issue submitting. See [Grading](#grading) below for the
required submissions and how that correlates with your grade.

### Weekly Quizzes

Each week there will be an online, untimed, multiple-tries quiz due on
_Mondays at 9 am_ before the first lecture session (except week 1, which will be due _Wednesday before 9am_). The purpose of this quiz is to make sure everyone has checked in on the concepts we will be using in lab on Tuesday and
Wednesday. They are open for late submission until the end of the quarter, but
see grading below for how late submissions correspond to grades.

Sometimes quizzes have associated readings or videos to supplement lecture.

### Lab Reports/Portfolio Posts

Every other Monday (that's in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) you will submit a lab report on
work from the previous week or two of lab material. This will take the form of
a blog post on a personal site you created in the first week.  At the end of
the quarter this means you'll have a personal web site with 5 posts detailing
what you learned.

For each post, our staff will review it and either give full credit or give
feedback; you must respond to the feedback to receive full credit on your post.
We'll post specific final deadlines for this feedback with each assignment.

### Skill Demonstrations

Several times during the quarter, you will complete a _skill demonstrations_
-- this course's version of exams. You'll be given a problem to practice in
advance, and then in the demo you'll demonstrate that you can do the task plus some follow-up tasks that are presented during the demonstration.
You can look at the skill demonstrations
from previous offerings for a sense of what tasks we assign (though we may or
may not use the same types in this offering) [[W22 demo
1]](https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/week/week5/#skill-demonstration-1) [[W22
demo 2]](https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/week/week9/#skill-demonstration-2)

On each you'll get a **Full Pass**, **Partial Pass**, or **Try Again** as your score.
In finals week, you'll have the opportunity to improve scores for some number of skill demonstrations.

There will be skill demonstrations in weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9 of the quarter. More details
about how you'll complete them will be shared in lab (you'll practice the format and we'll talk about
scheduling them).

## Grading {#grading}

Each component of the course has a minimum achievement level to get an A, B, or
C in the course. You must reach that achievement level in _all_ of the
categories to get an A, B, or C.

- **A** achievement:
    - 8 or more lab participation (out of 10 labs)
    - All 5 lab reports completed, at least 4 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - **Full Pass** on any 3 of the skill demonstrations, **Partial Pass** on the 4th
    (either initially or with the final make-up)
- **B** achievement:
    - 6 or 7 lab participation
    - All 5 lab reports completed, at least 2 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - **Full Pass** on any two skill demonstrations, at least a **partial pass** on the other two, OR **Full Pass** on 3 skill demonstrations and one missing/no pass (either initially or with the final make-up)
- **C** achievement:
    - 4 or 5 lab participation
    - At least 3 lab reports completed, at least 2 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Full Pass on at least one skill demonstration, Partial Pass or above on at least 2 skill demonstrations (either initially or with the final make-up)


Pluses and minuses will be given around the boundaries of these categories at
the instructor's discretion and based on quiz/lecture participation.  I don't
publish an exact number for these in advance, but it's consistent across the
class. A general guideline is: if you submit all of the lecture handouts and
all of the quizzes on time and complete, that will definitely add a `+` to the
grade. If you submit no lecture handouts and no quizzes, that will definitely
add a `-` to the grade.  If you submit about half of each and get things generally
mostly correct, there will be no modifier.

## Academic Integrity

Individual assignments describe policies specific to the assignment. Some
general policies for the course are here.

### Lab Reports and Academic Integrity

You can use code that we provide or that your group develops in lab as part of
your lab report. Your lab reports can be public. All of the *writing* in lab
reports must be your own.

You **can** use an AI assistant like ChatGPT or Copilot to help you author lab
reports or write code in this class. If you do, you are **required** to include
a section of your lab report that shows:

- The prompts you gave to ChatGPT, or the context in which you used Copilot
  autocomplete
- What its output was and how you changed the output after it was produced

This helps us _all_ learn how these new, powerful, and little-understood tools
work (and don't).

### Skill Demonstrations and Academic Integrity

Instructions for skill demonstrations will be posted in the week before they happen.
You're free to collaborate with others on preparing for
the skill demonstration, trying things out beforehand, and so on.

You **cannot** share details of _your_ skill demonstration with others until
after you receive your grade for it.

### Quizzes and Academic Integrity

You can work on weekly quizzes with other students.
