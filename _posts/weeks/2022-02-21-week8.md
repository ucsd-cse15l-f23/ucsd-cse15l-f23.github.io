## Lab Tasks

Discuss with your group:

### Editing at the Command Line

**Everyone** should do this; it's skill practice that you all need.

Clone (or pull if you've already cloned) **your** copy of
`week8lab` onto ieng6. We have provided you think link here:
[week8lab](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f23/week8lab.git)

Make sure you can use `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` to build it and `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore HandlerTests` run your tests. Note that since you last saw ChatServer, our devs have updated a key known bug where the main method did not match the name of the java file. It has since been fixed and the main method is now `ChatServer`.

Still on your own, open the test file by giving it as an argument to `vim`, like
`vim HandlerTests.java` (you might need to `cd` into the repository
directory first). Add a test using the vim editing commands you learned, then
save, quit, and rerun the tests.

You've just done programming entirely on ieng6; you didn't need VScode at all,
just a terminal!

As a group, discuss and **write in notes**:

- What were two things you thought were annoying about using Vim? Be specific.
- What were two things you thought were cool about using Vim? Be specific.

### Using a Debugger

Do this part as a group, while logged into someone's account on `ieng6`. Here we will look at a branch in our code that is currently in developement and a work in progress. You and your group have been tasked with testing the new beta branch which adds functionality to the original ChatServer.

1. Make a fresh clone of [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/week8lab](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/week8lab)
2. In the checkout, run </br>`javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` </br> and </br>`java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore HandlerTests` </br>Notice that we have test failures.
3. ## Use `jdb` with `ChatServer` to run _just that markdown file_ from the command line using the `main` method of `ChatServer`. Take use `jdb` commands to get the following information and take screenshots of it:
    - The stack trace when the exception is happening
    - The local variables in `getLinks` when the exception is happening
4. Next, use `jdb` to run the JUnit tests.You can refer to the lecture videos for a good way to
do this. Again, use `jdb` commands to find:
    - The stack trace when the exception is happening
    - The local variables in `getLinks` when the exception is happening

Then, diagnose and fix the bug so that all the tests pass. Make a commit with
the fix and push it, then link to the commit in your notes.


Write down in notes answers to these additional questions:

- What is information that you were able to get via `jdb` that you would be
unable to get via the stack trace of the exception?
- What are some pros and cons of using `jdb` to get information vs. adding print
statements to do so?
- Discuss the `findCloseParen` method ‚Äì¬†are there other places in parsing
markdown where a method like this may be useful?


### More Debugger Uses

Switch to another student to screenshare, still using `ieng6`.

Change `findCloseParen` so that it has an infinite loop (for example, remove the
increment `closeParen++`, or change the condition). Re-run `make test` and
verify that a test is in an infinite loop.

Practice using `jdb` with `suspend` to pause the program and show the stack
trace during the loop. You should be able to identify:

- Which test is triggering the infinite loop
- Which line the program stopped on when the program was `suspend`ed
- What the current values of all the variables are in `getCloseParen` at the
moment the program suspended

Take a screenshot or copy/paste of your `jdb` session and indicate in your notes
each of the three items above and how your `jdb` session informs you of that.


## Week 8 Lab Report

Consider the following chat histories between the professors:

### Snippet 1

```
[Joe]: Hey, did you hear about the Java developer who walked into a bar?

[Edwin]: No, what happened?

[Joe]: He said, "Give me a strong cup of Java! And make it Object-Oriented!" ‚òïÔ∏èüòÑ

[Onat]: Haha, that's a good one, Joe! Speaking of Java, did you know that Monty Python's Holy Grail was written in Java?

[Edwin]: Really? I thought it was written in Python!

[Onat]: Well, that would make more sense, wouldn't it? But it seems they had a "Java Holy Grail" moment! üèÜüòÇ

[Joe]: And let's not forget the Java programmers who always have to deal with "NullPointerExceptions."

[Edwin]: Yeah, they're like the Knights Who Say "Null"! They're always on a quest to find that elusive object.

[Onat]: True, true! And when they finally find it, they shout, "Eureka!" just like Archimedes.

[Joe]: Haha, the life of a Java developer can be quite the adventure, just like a Monty Python sketch!

[Edwin]: Indeed! But at the end of the day, we all know that "The Spam of Java is not a valid beverage!" üçñüö´‚òïÔ∏è

[Onat]: Well said, Edwin! Let's keep the Java and Python jokes rolling, and help our student's code be as legendary as a Monty Python tale! üòÑüêçüë®‚Äçüíª
```

### Snippet 2

```
[Onat]: Hey guys, have do you know why the chicken crossed the road?

[Edwin]: Was it late to class?

[Joe]: To get to the other side?

[Onat]: No, to escape the Ministry of Silly Walks! üòÑ

[Edwin]: And did you hear about the lumberjack who wanted to be a dentist?

[Onat]: Nope, what happened?

[Edwin]: He got tired of the daily grind! üå≤üòÅ

[Joe]: That's a good one, Edwin! But let me tell you about the time I tried to buy a shrubbery for my garden...

[Onat]: A shrubbery, you say? Did the Knights Who Say "Ni" give you a hard time?

[Joe]: They did! They demanded a sacrifice of... a herring! üêü

[Edwin]: Well, that's not too bad. At least they didn't ask for a dead parrot. ü¶ú

[Onat]: Ah, the dead parrot sketch! I love how they could turn the most ordinary situations into comedy gold.

[Joe]: Absolutely! It's like their humor is a cross between a witty intellectual and a three-headed knight!

[Joe]: Agreed! Now, let's not be too silly and get back to work before we end up in a sketch ourselves. üòÑ
```

### Snippet 3

```
[Joe]: Hey, have you heard about the Java bug that's as elusive as the Force?

[Edwin]: No, tell me more!

[Joe]: Well, it's like a Jedi mind trick. It only appears when you're not looking for it! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[Onat]: Haha, that sounds like a classic Java bug. But you know what's even more mysterious? Jar Jar Binks's role in Star Wars!

[Edwin]: Oh, Jar Jar... He's the real mystery of the galaxy. Maybe he's secretly a Java developer trying to fix bugs in the codebase.

[Joe]: Or perhaps he's a Sith Lord in disguise, using the Dark Side of the Force to cause those Java bugs!

[Onat]: That would explain a lot! "Meesa causing bugs, oopsie!" üòÇ

[Edwin]: And when you finally find a solution to a tricky Java bug, it's like saying, "These aren't the bugs you're looking for!"

[Joe]: Absolutely! You wave your hand and hope the bug disappears. But it usually doesn't work that way.

[Onat]: Well, as they say in the Java world, "May the stack trace be with you!" üöÄüåå

[Edwin]: Haha, that's the programmer's version of "May the Force be with you!" Let's hope we can teach our students to squash those Java bugs and keep the galaxy safe from code errors!

[Joe]: Agreed! And may our code be as strong as the Force itself. ü§ñüëæüíª
```

For **each** snippet, add a test both to **your** implementation of
markdown-parse, _and_ the implementation you reviewed in week 7. Run the tests and show
the results of running the tests on each. This means you should add a total of
**6** test methods (3 to your implementation and 3 to the one you reviewed).

This means you will need to clone and run both your implementation and the one
you reviewed in week 7, make some small edits, and run them both.

Your report should include:

- A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7
- For each test above:
    - Decide on what it _should_ produce by using either VScode preview or [the CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/)
    - Showing the code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for how you turned it into a test
    - For **your implementation**, the corresponding output when running the
    tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn't pass, show the specific part of
    the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
    - For **the implementation you reviewed in Week 7**, the corresponding output when running the
    tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn't pass, show the specific part of
    the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
- Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:
    - Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your
    program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with
    backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would
    be a more involved change.
    - Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your
    program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses,
    brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not,
    describe why it would be a more involved change.
    - Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your
    program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in
    brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe
    why it would be a more involved change.


If you're using a direct clone to `ieng6`, you might find it useful to give an
extra argument to `git clone` that specifies which directory to clone into, for
example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse markdown-parse-target-directory
```

Add your lab report as `lab-report-4-week-8` within the same Github pages lab
reports repository you've been using all quarter, and include all of the
elements above.
