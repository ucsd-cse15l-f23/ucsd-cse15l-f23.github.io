## Lab Tasks

As usual, you can read ahead and are encouraged to prepare! Keep in mind that
the lab isn't guaranteed to be final until the day of the lab, and a lot of the
exercises are collaborative, so you can't truly “finish it ahead of time”.
    
Today we'll use some of what we learned about URLS to create a **web server**.
    
### Meet Your New Group!

We have assigned you into groups that you will collaborate in for the rest of the
quarter. When you arrive at your lab, see the screen at the front of the room to
find your assigned seat.

**Write down in notes** – In your groups, share, and note in the running notes
document (discussion leaders, you answer these as well!):

- How you'd like people to refer to you (pronounce your name/nickname, pronouns
like he/her/they, etc)
- Your major
- One of:
    - A UCSD student organization you're a member of or interested in
    - Your favorite place you've found on campus so far
    - A useful campus shortcut or trick you know
- Your answer to the following question. Discuss why you chose that answer. ![Image](../../images/owls.png)

### Getting Set Up

#### Downloading Java JDK
If you don't have Java already installed, (CSE 12 students most likely already have) go ahead and download
the latest Java JDK version from this [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) link.
Download the version that has "Installer" in the file name for your specific device (Linux, macOS, Windows).

#### Cloning with Github Desktop

There are many ways to download the code from your repository and upload
changes. We will use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to do this
today, and see other options in the future. Even if you have some other
preferred way to do this that you've used before, please do follow the tutorial!
You may learn something new and useful.

Download the [Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) for Github. Install
it, and log in with your Github account. The startup page should look something
like this:

![](/images/github-desktop.png)

Then, you can get the code from your repository in one of several ways:

- On the repository page, there is a `<> Code` button; you can click on that and
choose “Open with Github Desktop”
- From Github Desktop, you can choose “Clone a Repository from the Internet” and
then choose your repository

To test it out, try cloning your lab reports repository. You'll see a message
about cloning, and then see this page:

![](/images/github-after-clone.png)

One thing that I often find a little surprising about this page is that it
doesn't list any files – `index.md` is nowhere to be found here! This is because
Github Desktop (and the underlying tool, `git`) are all about tracking and
recording _changes_; we won't see much in this interface until we make some
edits or create some new files.

Later in the lab, you'll clone another repository and work with it a bit, so
you'll see how this works.

### The `URLHandler` Interface

There's a lot that web servers can do. We will start with a small fragment of
their behavior that is enough to do interesting work. For now we'll focus on
programs that take a URL as input and respond with the text of a web page. We'll
call the part of the program that does this processing a `URLHandler`:

```
interface URLHandler {
  String processRequest(URI uri);
}
```

We'll also use a class that takes a `URLHandler` and starts up the server that
listens for incoming connections.

```
class Server {
  static void start(int port, URLHandler handler) { ... }
}
```

(Note that it says `URI`, not `URL`. There isn't a meaningful difference between
these concepts for our purposes, and all the URIs we work with are also URLs.
Java has [good documentation on
URI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URI.html). We'll discuss
what a `port` is below.).

We've provided an implementation of a web server that works with this interface here:

[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet)

Everyone in your group should make a **fork** of this repository.

The fork button is on the upper right:

![](/images/fork-button.png)

This makes a copy of the repository on in your Github account. Then, clone the
repository that you forked (not the original!) using Github Desktop, and open it
in Visual Studio Code.

There are two files in this repository:

- `Server.java` – we wrote this and you can treat it as a “black box”, without
understanding its details for today. Of course, you're welcome to read it and
ask questions about it, but we might defer your questions to Edstem, office
hours, or later to focus on the work specific to this lab.
- `NumberServer.java` – this is a program with a `main` method that creates a
`URLHandler` that manages a single number, and uses `Server.java` to start a web
server using that handler.

Read through the code in `NumberServer.java`. Discuss with your partner what you think each line or code block does. 

**Write down in notes** - What questions do you and your partner still have? It’s OK to have open questions at this point! Many will be resolved by the next few sections.

### Building and Running the Server

You can build and run the server on your local computer using these two
commands, from the working directory of the clone of the repository. It should
look like this when it works:

```
⤇ javac Server.java NumberServer.java 
⤇ java NumberServer 4000
Server Started! Visit http://localhost:4000
```

Then, in a browser on your computer, open
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You should see something that
looks like this:

![localhost_4000](/images/localhost_4000.png)

There are a few definitions worth discussing here:

- **Ports**: The `4000` above identifies a specific _port_ that the web server
runs on. This is an extra part of a URL that's often used in development; `4000`
isn't special and you could pick others – you're welcome to try a few in the
thousands; it won't break anything.  Sites on the public web actually use a port
as well, either
[`80`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_) or
[`443`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), but your browser hides it from you
because it's the default. You're welcome to read about these details, but they
aren't necessary to learn the relevant stuff in this lab.

- **Localhost**: The `localhost` domain refers to _the computer you're on_. So
rather than going out over the internet to send the URL to a particular domain
somewhere else, this page is being handled by the running Java program on your
computer, which we say is “listening” on localhost at port 4000. That work is
what's done in `Server.java` and by Java's `HTTPServer` library.

It's also worth pointing out that the terminal will just sit there without
letting you type more commands while the server is running: it is in an infinite
loop waiting for the next URL request to come in! You can stop the server by
pressing `Ctrl-c` (this works for any terminal command that's in an infinite
loop).

Try out URLs with paths and queries on the running server as described in
`NumberServer.java`. Based on the code, what paths and query combinations do you
think will have interesting effects? Try them out!

Try editing line 11 of `NumberServer.java` to include your name before the number is displayed. Example output: ``` [Your Name]’s number: 3 ```

Because we’ve made a new change to our server, we need to restart the server for those changes to be displayed on the web browser. 
To stop the server, press `Ctrl-C`, then restart the server by running the same commands as earlier that we used to start it (`javac` and `java` commands). 

In order for these changes to appear on GitHub, we need to **commit** and **push** them. Open your GitHub Desktop window, and it should show that you have made a change in the `wavelet` respository as seen in the image below. Click the button shown at the bottom left that says `Commit to master`.

![commit_github_desktop](/images/commit-github-desktop.png)

Next, for the changes to actually appear on GitHub, you need to **push** them. GitHub Desktop should now display a new screen. Click the `Push origin` button displayed in the screenshot below.

![push_github_desktop](/images/push-github-desktop.png)

Now your changes to this repository should be visible in GitHub!

**Write down in notes** – show a screenshot of trying each of the paths that
provide a response based on your reading of `NumberServer.java`. There should be
4: the root path, one for incrementing, one for adding by a specific count, and
one that shows an error.

### Run the Server on a Remote Computer

Next, log into your course account on `ieng6`. Then run this command:

```
git clone <your-repository-url-for-your-fork>
```

Feel free to ask your lab tutor for help doing this, and
there might even be strategies that you can find as a group that make it easier
to get the code onto the server! However you do it, make note of how you copied,
built, and ran the code. (**HINT:** Take a look at some of the commands shown in this week's lecture material for tips on how to copy files over.)

Now, run your web server on `ieng6` using the same `java` and `javac` commands that you used to run it on your local machine. Note that there are only 3 ieng6 computers (you'll see that you've connected to
`ieng6-201`, `ieng6-202`, or `ieng6-203` in the prompt), which presents a
problem – each one only has one port `4000`. If multiple people try to use the
same port at the same time on the same computer, there will be an error:

```
[cs15lwi23@ieng6-202]:wavelet:123$ java NumberServer 4000
Exception in thread "main" java.net.BindException: Address already in use
        at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0(Native Method)
        at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:461)
        at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:453)
```
{: .remote}

So you can't *all* use port `4000`. If you want something unique for this lab
you can use `6000` + the number of the machine you're sitting in front of if in
room B260, and `7000` + that number if in room B270. Or experiment!

The cool thing about running it on these computers is you can access it from
other computers! After starting the server, you can load your web page from
other places! For example, if you're on `ieng6-201.ucsd.edu` running on port
1234, you can open `http://ieng6-201.ucsd.edu:1234` from another computer in the
lab or your laptop to see the output of the running server (this only works from
the UCSD network, so that means you'd need to be on the UCSD-Protected network).
Neat – you've deployed a web server!

**Write down in notes** - Take some screenshots of loading your web server running
on `ieng6`, and the commands you used to copy it over and run it. Did people
have different strategies?

**Write down in notes** - Team up with another member of your group that you haven't worked with yet.
Get their server URL and port number, and access their number server on
***your*** computer (**HINT**: You may want to share the URL and port number on
your group's Google Doc). Take a screenshot of ***your*** computer loading a webpage of
***their*** server, which should show the current number and their
name. Was their web server running on the same `ieng6` machine as yours? The same port?
<!-- Joe's answer: It’s stored on the heap as a field in a NumberServer object in the a Java process owned by cs15lwi23zz running on ieng6-201. -->

**Write down in notes** – If you have multiple browsers on different computers
all incrementing the number on one web server, do they all see one anothers'
increments? As accurately as possible, describe where the number is stored.

**Write down in notes** - Brainstorm a little bit. Now that you have the ability
to make a web server, what are some ideas for other applications you could
create? Think about things you could plausibly build with your knowledge of Java
plus this server interface.  What else might you need to go further?

### Accessing URLs from the Command Line with `curl`

A web browser isn't the only way to access web pages. There are also commands
that can be used to access URLs. One of these commands is called `curl`. You
can use it like this:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/WhereAmI/main/WhereAmI.java
```

You could visit that URL in a web browser (to see some Java code from class),
_or_ run the `curl` command from the command line with the URL as an argument.
By default `curl` prints out what it accesses to the terminal.

You can also use `curl` to load the URLs for the server! It has the same
restrictions on access as whatever computer you're running it from. So that
means from the terminal on your local computer, a `curl` command would load
`ieng6-20x` URLs if you're connected to `UCSD-Protected`. But you can also log
into an `ieng6` server from your terminal and run `curl` from there, and use
that method to test your web server even if your laptop isn't on
`UCSD-Protected`. Try both things – using `curl` from your computer's local
terminal and from one logged into ieng6 to access your server.

Keep in mind this might mean you need to open _two_ terminals, one to start the
server and one to load the URL.

**Write down in notes**. Take a screenshot of two terminals, side-by-side, one
running the server and one loading a URL it serves via `curl`.


### Make the Simplest “Search Engine”

Make a new file called `SearchEngine.java`. In it, implement a web server (like
`NumberServer.java`) that tracks a list of strings. It should support a path for
_adding_ a new string to the list, and a path for _querying_ the list of strings
and returning a list of all strings that have a given substring.

Examples of paths/queries:

```
/add?s=anewstringtoadd

/add?s=pineapple

/add?s=apple

/search?s=app
(would return pineapple and apple)
```

Discuss with your partner how you plan to add a new string to the list, query for it, and return a list of all strings with the given substring (as described above).

When you've implemented this (and even if you don't finish), push a copy of your
new server to your Github repository; we will use it and improve on it in future
labs.

**Write down in notes** – When you have something you want to share for your
search server, share the machine and port with others and try out one another's
servers! Can you have one person add some words that another person searches
for? As accurately as possible, describe where each list of strings is stored.
